<b>awslambdaproxy</b> 是 [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) 支持的 HTTP/SOCKS 网页代理. 它为来自AWS Lambda可用的所有地区的网络流量提供持续旋转的IP地址。目标是混淆您的流量，使其难以跟踪您作为用户使用的地址。

## Features
* HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy protocols support (including authentication).
* No special software required. Just configure your system to use a proxy.
* Each AWS Lambda region provides 1 outgoing IP address that gets rotated roughly every 4 hours. That means if you use 10 AWS regions, you'll get 60 unique IPs per day.
* Configurable IP rotation frequency between multiple regions.
* Personal proxy server not shared with anyone else.
* Mostly [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) compatible (see FAQ below).

## Project status
Current code status: <b>proof of concept</b>. This is the first Go application that I've ever written. It has no tests. It may not work. It may blow up. Use at your own risk.

## How it works
At a high level, awslambdaproxy proxies TCP/UDP traffic through AWS Lambda regional endpoints. To do this, awslambdaproxy is setup on a publicly accessible host (e.g. EC2 instance) and it handles creating Lambda resources that run a proxy server ([ginuerzh/gost](https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost)). Since Lambda does not allow you to connect to bound ports in executing functions, a reverse SSH tunnel is established from the Lambda function to the host running awslambdaproxy. Once a tunnel connection is established, all user traffic is forwarded through this reverse tunnel to the proxy server. Lambda functions have a max execution time of 5 minutes, so there is a goroutine that continuously executes Lambda functions to ensure there is always a live tunnel in place. If multiple regions are specified, user traffic will be routed in a round robin fashion across these regions.

## Installation

The easiest way is to download a pre-built binary from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dan-v/awslambdaproxy/releases) page.

## Usage

1. Copy `awslambdaproxy` binary to a publicly accessible linux host (e.g. EC2 instance, VPS instance, etc). You will need to open the following ports on this host:
    * Port 22 - functions executing in AWS Lambda will open SSH connections back to the host running `awslambdaproxy`, so this port needs to be open to the world. The SSH key used here is dynamically generated at startup and added to the running users authorized_keys file.
    * Port 8080 - the default configuration will start a HTTP/SOCKS proxy listener on this port with default user/password authentication. If you don't want to publicly expose the proxy server, one option is to setup your own VPN server (e.g. [dosxvpn](https://github.com/dan-v/dosxvpn) or [algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)), connect to it, and just run awslambdaproxy with the proxy listener only on localhost (-l localhost:8080).

2. Optional, but I'd highly recommend taking a look at the Minimal IAM Policies section below. This will get you scoped access keys for running setup and run commands. Otherwise, if you don't care about security you can always use an access key with full administrator privileges.

2. Run `awslambdaproxy setup`. 

    ```sh
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
    ./awslambdaproxy setup
    ```

3. Run `awslambdaproxy run`. 

    ```sh
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
    ./awslambdaproxy run -r us-west-2,us-west-1,us-east-1,us-east-2
    ```
    
3. Configure your web browser (or OS) to use the SOCKS5 proxy on the publicly accessible host running `awslambdaproxy` on port 8080.

## Minimal IAM Policies
* This assumes you have the AWS CLI setup with an admin user
* Create a user with proper permissions needed to run the setup command. This user can be removed after running the setup command.
```
aws iam create-user --user-name awslambdaproxy-setup
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name awslambdaproxy-setup --policy-name awslambdaproxy-setup --policy-document file://iam/setup.json
aws iam create-access-key --user-name awslambdaproxy-setup
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "awslambdaproxy-setup",
        "Status": "Active",
        "CreateDate": "2017-04-17T06:15:18.858Z",
        "SecretAccessKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "AccessKeyId": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
}
```
* Create a user with proper permission needed to run the proxy.
```
aws iam create-user --user-name awslambdaproxy-run
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name awslambdaproxy-run --policy-name awslambdaproxy-run --policy-document file://iam/run.json
aws iam create-access-key --user-name awslambdaproxy-run
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "awslambdaproxy-run",
        "Status": "Active",
        "CreateDate": "2017-04-17T06:18:27.531Z",
        "SecretAccessKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "AccessKeyId": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
}
```

## FAQ
1. <b>Should I use awslambdaproxy?</b> That's up to you. Use at your own risk.
2. <b>Why did you use AWS Lambda for this?</b> The primary reason for using AWS Lambda in this project is the vast pool of IP addresses available that automatically rotate.
3. <b>How big is the pool of available IP addresses?</b> This I don't know, but I do know I did not have a duplicate IP while running the proxy for a week.
4. <b>Will this make me completely anonymous?</b> No, absolutely not. The goal of this project is just to obfuscate your web traffic by rotating your IP address. All of your traffic is going through AWS which could be traced back to your account. You can also be tracked still with [browser fingerprinting](https://panopticlick.eff.org/), etc. Your [IP address may still leak](https://ipleak.net/) due to WebRTC, Flash, etc.
5. <b>How often will my external IP address change?</b> For each region specified, the IP address will change roughly every 4 hours. This of course is subject to change at any moment as this is not something that is documented by AWS Lambda.
6. <b>How much does this cost?</b> awslambdaproxy should be able to run mostly on the [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) minus bandwidth costs. It can run on a t2.micro instance and the default 128MB Lambda function that is constantly running should also fall in the free tier usage. The bandwidth is what will cost you money; you will pay for bandwidth usage for both EC2 and Lambda.
7. <b>Why does my connection drop periodically?</b> AWS Lambda functions can currently only execute for a maximum of 5 minutes. In order to maintain an ongoing proxy a new function is executed and all new traffic is cut over to it. Any ongoing connections to the previous Lambda function will hard stop after a timeout period. You generally won't see any issues for normal web browsing as connections are very short lived, but for any long lived connections you may see issues.
